## Course Description

In this course, we will explore recent advances in computing for augmenting human communication through language adaptation. We will cover foundational sociolinguistic theories of communication, and investigate new advances in HCI, NLP, and AI that aim to improve how we communicate with one another online. We will learn how to identify when language will impact behavior through empirical studies, and how to design, build and evaluate intelligent reading and writing tools. 

We will focus class on in-person discussions around research papers and advances. Students will be expected to read papers, post reading reflections, share and comment on papers and ideas, and lead at least one class discussion. The class will culminate in a research project focused on studying languageâ€™s effect on behavior and/or building a tool using current language technologies. Classes will not be recorded.

## Learning Objectives 
- Understand current research issues at the intersection of HCI and NLP
- Critique research on human-centered language technologies
- Create research projects focused on enhancing communication with technology

Assigned readings will be linked in the class schedule. There are no required texts. More details about the assignments are in the [Assignments](/assignments.md) section.


## Mental Health
Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating and/or sleeping can interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or someone you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly encouraged to contact or visit any of the University's resources provided below. Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself and for those who care about you.

## Language Model Use Policy 

The goal of this course is to think critically about current computing research on improving our use of language with technology. Language models (LMs) and chat assistants (e.g., ChatGPT) are some of the technologies we will be discussing in class, including how we can use them to write and read more effectively. For that reason, we are allowing the use of LMs to assist you in completing assignments. However, the use of any LM comes with the following requirements: 

- The output of the LM **cannot be the final output** that you submit for the assignment. 
- You must **disclose** the use of the LM on the assignment. 
- When you discclose LM use, also include 2-3 sentences **describing** why you used the LM, what you used it for, what you found helpful about using the LM, and what were limitations you had to work around. 

The structure and content of this course has been inspired by Eshwar Chandrasekharan's [Social Computing](http://www.eshwarchandrasekharan.com/spring2022-cs598.html) course, and Katharina Reinecke's [Computer Ethics](https://uw-cse599p.github.io/) course.
